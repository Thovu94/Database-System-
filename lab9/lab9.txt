+ Code, Category nad Name are good candidates to index because they are small columns with relatively small records. 

-In airlines:
+ Code, Name, Short_name, and Country should be index because the same previous reasons.

- In airports:
+ Code, Name, City, Sate, Country, latitude, longtitude, utc_offset and dst are good candiates to index since they can be used as a condition in ORDER BY or WHERE clause.

- In Countries:
+ Code, Name, and Continent should be indexed because these columns consist of a small amount of records. Index will work affectively.

- In flights:
+ Departure, arrival, day_op, dep_time and duration are not good candidates to index. Too much data can be updated, it will spend more time to index.
+ Carrier, airline, flightnum, and aircraft will be perfectly indexed.
